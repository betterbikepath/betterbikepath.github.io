            <h2>Why Better Bikepath Was Created </h2>
            <p>
                Created for HackMIT on September 14-15th 2024 by four students. We have a concern for bike paths in Boston as Google Maps often 
                leads bikers on dangerous paths such as highways, crossing illegal roads, etc.

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
                We hope to <strong> improve safety, increase use of bikers, and foster Boston to be a more green city. </strong> The roads in Boston
                are already super run down and are constantly being worked on. However, bike lanes are not as focused on despite it seeming like
                there are secure, fenced off bike lanes everywhere. Some bike lines split from one side to the other of the road in the middle of an
                intersection, which is not only dangerous for the biker, but also for any drivers on the road.
